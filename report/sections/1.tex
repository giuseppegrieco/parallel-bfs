\subsection{Problem statement}
The bread-first search is an algorithm visiting the graph in amplitude. It starts from a node, 
often called the root or source node, and continues visiting all its descendants level
by level, whereas the $i$-th level will contain all the nodes at a distance $i$ from the root.
For each node visited the algorithm checks its label to count the occurrences of the target label.
The assumption underlying all the work is that the input to the problem is a direct and 
acyclic graph. In addition, for the sake of clarity, the notation used is summarized below:
\\

Let $\mathcal{G} = (V, E)$, $|V| = n$ is the number of node and $|E| = m$ is the number of edges. 
For all the node $v \in V$:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\mathcal{N}(v) = \{u : (u, v) \in E\}$ is the neighborhood of $v$;
    \item $k_{in}(v) = |\{e: e=(u, v) \in E\}|$ is the in-degree of $v$;
    \item $k_{out}(v) = |\mathcal{N}(v)|$ is the out-degree of $v$;
    \item $k(v) = k_{in}(v) + k_{out}(v)$ is the degree of $v$.
    \item $d(u, v)$ is the distance from $u$ to $v$, i.e. the minimum path from $u$ to $v$.
\end{itemize}
Using the node-focus notation above,
 it is possible to define general properties for the graph:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\bar{k}$ is the average degree;
    \item $\bar{d}$ is the average distance;
    \item $d_{max}$ is the diameter.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Preliminary analysis}
\subsubsection{Data structure}
Before entering in the algorithmic details let's first introduce the data structure used.
There are many ways to represent a graph among these the main ones are adjacency list and adjacency
matrix. The choices among them is mainly a matter of the usage of the adjacency information and the 
expected nature of the graph. As for every node $v$ of the graph, induced by the root, it will be necessary
to go through each node $u \in \mathcal{N}(v)$, the adjacency list is way more efficient since for each
node $v$ the listing of $\mathcal{N}(v)$ takes a time proportional to $k_{out}(v)$, which is thus optimal.
Moreover, if the expected input of the algorithm are "real" graphs than since they are very sparse, the representation as a adjacency list is way 
more efficient in terms of space complexity.
\\
In particular the presented version represent a graph $G$ as a vector of nodes.
 The node is a pair, the first component is the label of the node, while the second
 component is the adjacency list containing the indices of the nodes in the graph.
\subsubsection{Sequential version}
The sequential version is a straightforward implementation of the problem
description. It makes usage of two vector $F$ and $\hat{F}$: the former is the frontier 
while the latter is used to add new nodes and therefore represents the frontier 
to be used in the next iteration. At the beginning, the algorithm initializes the frontier
with the neighborhood of the source node and marks each child as visited. Then it marks the source node 
as visited and updates occurrences if needed (i.e. if the root has the searched label). After this first phase,
 the algorithm starts the first loop which iterates on each level checking that $F$ is not empty.
 Subsequently, for each level, it goes through each node $v \in F$, updates occurrences if needed and
 then goes through each node $u \in \mathcal{N}(v)$.
 For each node $u$ in the neighborhood, if the node $u$ is not marked as visited, 
 it adds $u$ to $\hat{F}$. After having exhausted all the nodes of $F(i)$, the algorithm
 swaps $F$ with $\hat{F}$ and then clears $\hat{F}$.
